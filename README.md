# capaPlan
ultimate capacity planning tool<br />
Here is the what we want to achieve<br />

The essence is to move from doing the stuff to doing the stuff that do the stuff.<br />

Understand that our job is full of (resentful) repetitions (cycles of studies of all kinds and names, are they NOT the same stuff?).<br />
I want to eliminate repetition and make our jobs more meaningful.<br />
because of repetition (and inefficiency of shared files, humongous excel files, antique company software), <br />
we begin to question our value (why am i doing this #$%^?), <br />
we begin to feel frustration (mouse flied over), <br />
we begin to regret (why am i here?????)<br />

hope you can join me to make this happen.<br />

hopefully, with this we are able to cater for all kinds of requests in a more pleasant way, and the same job will not require more effort than a few lines of code.<br />
the rest of time, we could dedicate to make this system more and more robust and up to the morning day requirement and latest patches of python package.<br />

here is why python is chosen:<br />

it is an robust and up-to-date language<br />
code somehow follows english grammar<br />
it is an OOP language<br />
fast to learn<br />

why company software + excel is abandoned:<br />

company software is developed in the 1999, function is rigid, thus we invented ADDER to make it flexible<br />
ADDER in excel made thins better, also made things worse (chaotic version control, un-savable shared files, unreadable excel super long formulas, super inefficient VBA codes)<br />



1. Create a capacity simulation tool that is suitable for most of the manufacturing environments.<br />
2. Create a scenario study pack to analyse what if conditions, and give summaries<br />
3. move on to the capex changes<br />
