# capaPlan
ultimate capacity planning tool

here is the what we want to do

the essence is to move from doing the stuff to doing the stuff that do the stuff.

understand that our job is full of (resentful) repetition (cycles of MOR, ECN, GAP, are they NOT the same stuff?).
I want to eliminate repetition and make our jobs more meaningful.
because of repetition (and inefficiency of shared files, humongous excel files, antique company software), 
we begin to question our value (why am i doing this #$%^?), 
we begin to feel frustration (mouse flied over), 
we begin to regret (why am i here?????)

hope you can join me to make this happen.

hopefully, with this we are able to cater for all kinds of requests in a more pleasant way, and the same job will not require more effort than a few lines of code.
the rest of time, we could dedicate to make this system more and more robust and up to the morning day requirement and latest patches of python package.

here is why python is chosen:

it is an robust and up-to-date language
code somehow follows english grammar
it is an OOP language
fast to learn

why company software + excel is abandoned:

company software is developed in the 1999, function is rigid, thus we invented ADDER to make it flexible
ADDER in excel made thins better, also made things worse (chaotic version control, un-savable shared files, unreadable excel super long formulas, super inefficient VBA codes)



1. Create a capacity simulation tool that is suitable for most of the manufacturing environments.
2. Create a scenario study pack to analyse what if conditions, and give summaries
3. move on to the capex changes
